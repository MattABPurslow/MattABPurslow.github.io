title: About Matt Purslow

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Matt Purslow!</h1>
	<p>I'm an Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences PhD student at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
	<h2>PhD</h2>
	p>I use satellites to measure the structure of forests, and then use those measurements to improve snow models. I am supervised by Steven Hancock, Richard Essery and Noel Gourmelen, and funded by NERC through Edinburgh's E4 Doctoral Training Partnership</p>
	<h2>Undergraduate</h2>
	<p>Before starting my PhD, I studied Geophysics and Meteorology at Edinburgh, earning the grandiose title "Master of Earth Physics". During my undergraduate, I researched whether it was possible to measure the greenhouse effect with an infrared thermometer and a hill (not really!) and the temperature and infrared emissivity of Arctic surface snow. Both projects were supervised by Prof. Richard Essery.</p>
	<p>My study of Arctic surface snow began as a summer placement at the Met Office, supervised by Jennifer Brooke, looking at data collected during the MACSSIMIZE campaign of March 2018.</p>
