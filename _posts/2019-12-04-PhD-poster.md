Being at the start of the PhD journey, a lot of my time in the last three months (wow, three months already!) has been dedicated to working out what I want to investigate with the time I have, and how I might do it. Consequently, I've been writing a "PhD plan", a long and slightly tedious block of text outlining where the field is, where it could be, and how to get there.

But reading is tiring. I've therefore tried to present my thoughts in a slightly more enticing way. The result? A poster representing the environment, processes and measurement techniques I plan to study and utilise over the next three and a bit years. Check it out ([pdf here](https://github.com/mattabpurslow/MattABPurslow.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/blog-images/phd_schematic.pdf)).
