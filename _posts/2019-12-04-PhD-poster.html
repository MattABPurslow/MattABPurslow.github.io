<p>Being at the start of the PhD journey, a lot of my time in the last three months (wow, three months already!) has been dedicated to working out what I want to investigate with the time I have, and how I might do it. Consequently, I've been writing a "PhD plan", a long and slightly tedious block of text outlining where the field is, where it could be, and how to get there.</p>

<p>But reading is tiring. I've therefore tried to present my thoughts in a slightly more enticing way. The result? A poster representing the environment, processes and measurement techniques I plan to study and utilise over the next three and a bit years. Check it out (<a url="/assets/images/blog-images/phd_schematic.pdf">pdf here</a>).</p>
